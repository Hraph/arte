When we call the first time the method $.arte(), we can add some options like *$.arte(options).*

The options must have to be in the following format:
{{{
$.arte({'option_name_1':value, 'option_name_2': value, ...});
}}}

We can notice that we can set options after the initialization by using the 'set' method:
{{{
$.arte().set('option_name', new_value);
}}}

*Here is now the list of available options*

  * 'start'
Can be true or false
It start immediatly the loop, no needs to call the method start.

  * 'time'
It is an integer
It is the timer tick between each call of the loop

  * 'ajax_mode'
Can be 'GET' or 'POST'
It is used for the ajax query inside the loop.

  * 'ajax_type'

Most common are 'text' or 'xml'

  * 'ajax_url'

  * 'on_data_set'
It set the function which will be called before each ajax request to build the arguement string, so this function has to return a string type.
